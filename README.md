Three types of bots:

Vanity bot - It always repeats whatever it heard including itself. I used P5.speech written by R. Luke DuBois for speech synthesis and speech recognition.

After closely studying opera scripts, Bot Learning Opera will respond with whatever it thinks has a similar contextual value. The bot uses the ML.5 js algorithms to generate it’s understanding model.

Rhyming bot - I used Pronouncing python library written by Allison Parrish to generate rhyme words. It will reply by rhyming the word it heard. 

All bots have random speed and pitch. These spark machine errors while listening and contribute to the performance sound composition. 

All Three bots

**Tiri Kananuruk** 

She went to the same undergrad with Jann but in exhibition design.Every time Jann’s class sang next to her class, She always lip synced them. Now she studies programming at ITP NYU. She still can’t sing. During her time in school, she made a program to sing for her instead. She also explored with machine learning to think for her. Actually, this bio was written by a machine
